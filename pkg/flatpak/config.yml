# What log level should onedriver use (debug, info, and "warn" are recommended).
# - trace - Log everything, including every syscall handled by the filesystem.
# - debug - Log all operations that modify a file or directory.
# - info - Log "big" operations like uploads and downloads.
# - warn - These are warnings. Usually not a problem.
# - error - Things that onedriver doesn't like, but can continue running
#          (can possibly result in file corruption or inability to do something).
# - fatal - Only log errors that kill the program (this log level is not recommended).
log: error
