onedriver (0.14.0-2) jammy; urgency=low

  * This is a dummy release to forcibly refresh the GPG key in the Debian OBS repositories. 
    No actual changes.

onedriver (0.14.0-1) jammy; urgency=low

  * We now use quickxorhash checksums for both personal and business accounts.
  * The cache for file contents has been moved out of boltdb and onto the local filesystem.
    This makes accessing, reading, and writing files faster than before.
  * onedriver no longer allows you to create filenames that are not allowed by OneDrive.

onedriver (0.13.0-1) focal; urgency=low

  * The GUI has been rewritten in golang for ease of maintenance and code sharing with 
    the rest of the onedriver application.
  * onedriver can now be configured with a config file at "~/.config/onedriver/config.yml".
  * There is now a configuration menu in the GUI. You can now set a couple configuration
    options that were previously only possible with "systemctl edit".
  * The onedriver CLI now stores its cache in the same path that the GUI expects,
    meaning that invoking the onedriver filesystem directly and via the GUI will share the
    cache as long as the mountpoint is the same.
  * onedriver now prefers multipart downloads for files >10MB instead of a single massive 
    GET request. This should significantly improve reliability when working with large files.

onedriver (0.12.0-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Major internal rewrite - onedriver now talks directly to the kernel instead of using
    go-fuse/fs as an intermediary. This makes metadata operations a bit faster.
  * onedriver better handles completion of multipart uploads and does not repeatedly
    upload files on success. This significantly improves upload speed.
  * Fixes a crash when writes begin at an offset beyond maximum file length. This fixes a
    bug where running ld inside the filesystem would cause it to crash.
  * Switch to using zerolog instead of logrus for logging. Though zerolog is supposedly 
    faster, the real reason to switch is that it's much easier for me (and hopefully you)
    to read. Also, pretty colors!
  * onedriver now gives you the option to choose to authenticate via the terminal when 
    authenticating via the new --no-browser option (this is the functionality from the 
    old "headless" build).
  * Add a workaround for the TLS cert authentication issue from
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024296

onedriver (0.11.2-1) focal; urgency=low

  * onedriver now disallows rmdir on nonempty directories.
  * The filesystem now detects if it is offline more reliably.

onedriver (0.11.1-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Fix startup crash in onedriver-launcher when onedriver has not been launched before.
 
 -- Jeff Stafford <jeff.stafford@protonmail.com>  Sun, 11 Jul 2021 00:30:00 -0400

onedriver (0.11.0-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Now includes a snazzy GUI for managing your mountpoints. No terminal skills are required
    to use onedriver now.
  * The upload logic has been rewritten to no longer use 0-byte files as placeholders in 
    any scenario. This fixes a race condition where software like LibreOffice, KeepassXC, or 
    Krita could generate a 0-byte file instead of the intended file when the file was 4MB or
    larger.
  * onedriver now uses etags AND modification times when syncing server-side changes back to
    the client. This reduces the number of times that files must be redownloaded because of
    bad timestamp data from the Microsoft API.

onedriver (0.10.1-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Fix the onedriver .desktop launcher so it uses the new systemd unit name.

onedriver (0.10.0-1) focal; urgency=low
    
  * Adds AUR installation method for Arch-based distros - thanks fmoledina!
  * Add manpage for onedriver - thanks GenericGuy!
  * The onedriver systemd service now restarts itself in the event of a crash -
    thanks dipunm!
  * Fix a rare crash while syncing server-side changes missing checksums.
  * Fix a race-condition that caused uploaded files to occasionally be replaced by a 0-byte 
    copy (most commonly caused by the way LibreOffice saves files).
  * Cap number of uploads that can be in-progress at any time to 5. This makes uploading 
    uploading directories with lots of files appear to go a bit faster.
  * The account name is now displayed in the title bar if you need to reauthenticate to
    OneDrive (makes it easier to know which credentials to use when prompted).

onedriver (0.9.2-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Adds fix for server-side update to Microsoft's authentication APIs.
  * Fix a crash on auth renewal after computer suspend or other network interruption.

onedriver (0.9.1-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Filenames are now sanitized when uploading new files.
  * onedriver now only syncs metadata changes for a file from server to client if its
    contents have changed as well. This means that programs like LibreOffice will no longer
    complain about their lockfiles being updated while saving.

onedriver (0.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple OneDrive drives can now be mounted simultaneously via systemd.
  * Uploads are now retried, with failed uploads retried automatically.
  * In-progress uploads are now cached on disk and resumed the next time onedriver starts
    if the upload is terminated prematurely (for instance, if a user shuts down their computer)
  * All uploads are now verified against checksums of their local content.

 -- Jeff Stafford <jeff.stafford@protonmail.com>  Wed, 3 Jun 2020 18:29:00 -0400

onedriver (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a desktop launcher for single drive scenarios (better multi-drive support coming soon!).
  * Fix for directories containing more than 200 items.
  * Miscellaneous fixes and tests for OneDrive for Business
  * Compatibility with Go 1.14
